# Study_Tracker
 
 Project Title: AI & ML Interactive Study Plan Tracker (Excel-Based)

 Objective: To organize and track progress across a 12-week AI & Machine Learning study plan using an interactive, visually engaging, and self-updating Excel dashboard.
 Weekly Topic Tracking: Each week includes specific AI/ML concepts (e.g., Python, NumPy, Supervised/Unsupervised Learning, NLP, CNNs).
 Progress Visualization: A dynamic bar chart shows weekly completion percentages.
 Interactive Checkboxes: Toggle-based progress tracking for topics, courses, and projects.

Skills Used:
  Excel (Formulas, Conditional Formatting, Data Validation, Charts)
  Self-paced Learning Strategy

Why I Built This:
  I wanted a way to stay accountable, consistent, and organized in my AI/ML learning journey. Instead of scattered notes or vague goals, I created this structured tool to help myself (and potentially others) stay on track with real-time feedback on progress.
